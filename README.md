# LaskaKit ESP32-C3-LPKit 

The main part of the [LaskaKit ESP32-C3-LPKit](https://www.laskakit.cz/laskkit-esp-12-board/?variantId=10482) development board is so popular Wi-Fi module ESP-C3-12F with ESP32-C3 IC, what is supported by manufacturer and huge community of makers. 

The board is pin-to-pin compatible with Wemos D1 Mini and doesn't include the USB-UART convertor what saves energy of the board. The LaskaKit ESP32-C3-LPkit is assembled by low-power regulator for 3.3V. Thanks to the regulator and used ESP32-C3 module, the whole board has so low power, the current of the board during deep sleep is only 7 uA.
